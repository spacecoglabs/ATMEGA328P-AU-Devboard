# ATMEGA328P-AU-Devboard
A simple KiCADv6 design for a ATMEGA328P-AU Development Board

## Overview 
This repository contains a simple KiCADv6 design for a ATMEGA328P-AU development board. All pins are broken out to headers for prototyping use, with a few exceptions. This design includes an external 16MHz oscillator, power indicator LED, and user controllable LED. The form factor of the board was designed to be as small as possible, without compromising usability. Power can be supplied through the screw terminal, or directly through the various 5V and GND pins.
